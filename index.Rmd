This website tracks COVID-19 data statewide and by county. Most of the State and County data for positive tests and deaths are gathered from The New York Times COVID-19 [repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and The Indiana Data [Hub](https://hub.mph.in.gov/dataset).   
  
Governor Holcomb's reopening plan begain on May 12th, 2020 and seems to follow the White House [plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/). Both are simliar to the [guidelines](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/) published by the American Enterpise Institute (AEI) and Johns Hopkins. Neither Governor Holcomb's nor the White House's plan includes the snapback (i.e. reverting to a previous stage) triggering conditions listed in the AEI proposal. Along with tracking virus spread metrics, I'll also be tracking as many of these triggers as I can with the data that's available.
